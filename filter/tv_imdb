=head1 NAME

tv_imdb - Augment XMLTV listings files with imdb.com data.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

tv_imdb --imdbdir <dir> [--help] [--quiet][[--prepStage (1-5,all)]| [--stats][--output FILE] [FILE...]]

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Very similar to tv_cat in symantics (see tv_cat)
except whenever a programme appears with "date" entry the
title and date are used to look up extra data by using the
XMLTV::IMDB package.

B<--output FILE> write to FILE rather than standard output

B<--quiet> disable all status messages (that normally appear on stderr).

B<--stats> force output of grab stats (stats output disabled in --quiet mode).

B<--movies-only> only augment programs that look like movie listings (4 digit
E<39>dateE<39> field).

All programs are checked against imdb.com data (unless --movies-only is used).

For the purposes of tv_imdb, an "exact" match is defined as a case
insensitive match gainst imdb.com data (which may or may not include the
transformation of E<39>&E<39> to E<39>andE<39> and vise-versa.

If the program includes a 4 digit E<39>dateE<39> field the following is
matches are attempted, the first succeeding match is used:

B<1.> an "exact" title/year match against movie titles is done

B<2.> an "exact" title match against tv series (and tv mini series)

B<3.> an "exact" title match against movie titles with production dates

within 2 years of the E<39>dateE<39> value.

Unless --movies-only is used, if the program does not include a 4 digit
E<39>dateE<39> field the following
matches are attempted, the first succeeding match is used:

B<1.> an "exact" title match against tv series (and tv mini series)

When a match is found in the imdb.com data the following is applied:

B<1.> the E<39>titleE<39> field is set to match exactly the title from the
imdb.com data. This includes modification of the case to match and any
transformations mentioned above.

B<2.> if the match is a movie, the E<39>dateE<39> field is set to imdb.com
4 digit year of production.

B<3.> the type of match found (Movie, TV Movie, Video Movie, TV Series,
or TV Mini Series) is placed in the E<39>categoriesE<39> field.

B<4.> the url to the www.imdb.com page is added

B<5.> the director is added if the match was a movie or if only one director
is listed in the imdb.com data (because some tv series have > 30 directors)

B<6.> the top 3 billing actors are added.

=head1 HOWTO
In order to use tv_imdb, you need:

B<1.> choose a directory location to use for the tv_imdb database (youE<39>ll
need about 1/2 GB of free space),

B<2.> run E<39>tv_imdb --imdbdir <dir> --prepStage allE<39>, it will fail,
giving you a list of files you need to download from imdb.com.

B<3.> download the list files (what imdb.com calls their E<39>plain textE<39>
interface) (see http://www.imdb.com/interfaces for locations etc).

B<4.> rerun tv_imdb with --prepStage all. This stage sucks a bit of memeory,
but you can run each prepStage separately by running --preStage with each of the
stages (see --help for details).

Once you have the database loaded try
E<39>cat tv.xml | tv_imdb --imdbdir <dir> > tv1.xmlE<39>.

Feel free to report any problems with these steps to xmltv-devel@lists.sf.net.

=head1 BUGS

Could use a --configure step just like the grabbers so you do not have
to specify the --imdbdir on the command line every time. Also this could
step you through the prep stages with more description of what is being
done and what is required. Configure could also control the number of
actors to add (since some movies have an awful lot), currently we are
adding the top 3.

How and what to look up needs to be option driven.

Needs some more controls for fine tuning "close" matches. For instance,
currently it looks like the tv_grab_na grabber only has date entries for
movies, but the imdb.com data contains made for video movies as well as
as real movies, ot is itE<39>s possible to get the wrong data to be inserted. In this
case we may want to say "ignore tv series" and "ignore tv mini series".
Along with this, weE<39>d want to define what a "close" match is. For instance
does a movie by the same title with a date out by 1 year or 2 years considered
a match (currently weE<39>re using 2).

Nice to haves include: verification/addition of programe MPAA/VCHIP ratings,
addition of imdb.com user ratings (by votes) to programes. Potenially we
could expand to include "country of origin", "description", "writer" and
"producer" credits, maybe even "commentator".

Heh, if the XMLTV.dtd supported it, we could even include urls to head
shots of the actors :)

Would be nice if xmltv as a whole supported gzipE<39>d and bzip2 files.
