Proper test suite is still todo.

sort.xml checks that sort_listings is idempotent.
test_livre.xml checks processing of non-ASCII characters (or at least
    one of them :-)).
test.xml is just an example XMLTV file.

We should use test_xmltv_module on all of these to make sure XMLTV.pm
can load and save all details.  Oh, and nsgmls after every filter
program to check it produces valid XML. 

I also have some live data which I use to test tv_extractinfo_en.  But
that is not legal to distribute, I'd have to write made-up listings
following the same sort of pattern.
