Proper test suite is still todo.

sort.xml checks that sort_listings is idempotent.
test_livre.xml checks processing of non-ASCII characters (or at least
    one of them :-)).
test.xml is just an example XMLTV file.

We should use test_xmltv_module on all of these to make sure XMLTV.pm
can load and save all details.  Oh, and nsgmls after every filter
program to check it produces valid XML. 

The most important tests are using live data, but it isn't possible to
distribute that :-(.
