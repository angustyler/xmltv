#
# This file contains programme titles/subtitles that should be processed in
# order to produce consistent programme titles and subtitles. Some programme
# entries in the listings data from the Radio Times contains subtitle/episode 
# information in the title field, others may contain the programme title
# and subtitle reversed, and yet more may contain 'season' information that is
# not part of the programme title. All of these entries have a colon separating
# the title and subtitle components; we therefore use the colon to split the 
# title and subtitle accordingly.
#
# By default, the tv_grab_uk_rt grabber will read this file and process any 
# matching programme titles found in the listings data against the flagged
# titles below. Title processing can be disabled using the '--no-title-updates'
# option.
#
# Each programme title to process is listed below, with one title per line.
# Comments are allowed and ignored. Each entry contains a number of 
# pipe-delimited fields, one of which should contain either a programme title 
# entry or non-title text seen in the Radio Times data. How the entry is 
# processed depends upon the field in which it is placed. Fields are used as
# follows:
#
# Field #1) Text in the first field is non-title text that is to be removed
#           from any programme titles found containing this text at the
#           beginning of the $title element, before the actual programme title.
#
# Field #2) Text in the second field is the desired title of a programme entry
#           which contains both the programme's title _and_ episode in the raw
#           listings data ($title:$episode). We reassign the episode information
#           to the $episode element (if empty), leaving only the programme title
#           in the $title element.
#
# Field #3) Text in the third field is the desired title of a programme entry
#           which contains the programme's episode followed by title in the raw
#           listings data ($episode:$title). We reassign the episode information
#           to the $episode element (if empty), leaving only the programme title
#           in the $title element.
#
# Field #4) Text in the fourth field is the desired title of a programme entry
#           which is listed in the raw listings data as the programme's
#           episode (i.e. the title and episode details have been reversed).
#           We therefore reverse the assignment to ensure the $title and 
#           $episode elements contain the correct information.

#
# Non-title information to remove from beginning of titles
