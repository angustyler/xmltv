#
# NOTE: The Radio Times (and others) have copyright over the description
#       text used in listings
#
# This file contains programme titles that should be processed in order to 
# produce more consistent programme titles and subtitles. Some programme
# entries in the listings data from the Radio Times contain subtitle/episode 
# information in the title field, others may contain the programme title
# and subtitle reversed, and yet more may contain 'season' information that is
# not part of the programme title. When these entries have a colon separating
# the title and subtitle components, we use the colon to split the title and 
# subtitle accordingly. We also flag specific programme titles that are given
# inconsistently across channels, and provide a consistent title to use in these
# cases.
#
# By default, the tv_grab_uk_rt grabber will read this file and process any 
# matching programme titles found in the listings data against the flagged
# titles below. Title processing can be disabled during configuration.
#
# Each programme title to process is listed below, with one title per line.
# Comments are allowed and ignored. Each entry contains 2 pipe-delimited 
# fields, the first of which should contain a procesing code, the second
# the programme title entry or non-title text seen in the Radio Times data. 
# How the entry is processed depends upon the value of the processing code in
# the first field. Processing codes used are:
#
# 1) The text in the second field is non-title text that is to be removed from
#    any programme titles found containing this text at the beginning of the 
#    <title> element, separated from the actual title with a colon.
#
# 2) The text in the second field is the desired title of a programme when the 
#    raw listings data contains both the programme's title _and_ episode in 
#    the title ($title:$episode). We reassign the episode information to the 
#    <episode> element, leaving only the programme title in the <title> element.
#
# 3) The text in the second field is the desired title of a programme when the
#    raw listings data contains both the programme's episode _and_ title in
#    the title ($episode:$title). We reassign the episode information to the
#    <episode> element, leaving only the programme title in the <title> element.
#
# 4) The text in the second field is the desired title of a programme which is 
#    listed in the raw listings data as the programme's episode (i.e. the title
#    and episode details have been reversed). We therefore reverse the 
#    assignment to ensure the <title> and <episode> elements contain the correct
#    information.
#
# 5) The text in the second field contains two programme titles, separated by a
#    tilde (~). The first title is the inconsistent programme title to search
#    for during processing, and the second title is a consistent title to
#    as a replacement in the listings output. Programme titles can be
#    inconsistent across channels (e.g. Law and Order vs Law & Order) or use
#    inconsistent grammar (xxxx's vs xxxxs'), so we provide a consistent 
#    title, obtained from the programme itself, its website or other media, 
#    to use instead.
#
# 6) The text in the second field contains a programme title and a programme 
#    category (genre), separated by a tilde (~). Categories can be assigned 
#    to uncategorised programmes (which can be determined by running the grabber
#    with debug output).
#
# 7) The text in the second field contains a programme title, an old episode
#    value and a new episode value, all separated by tildes (~).
#
# 8) The text in the second field contains an old programme title, an old episode
#    value, a new programme title and a new episode value. The old and new titles
#    MUST be given, the episode fields can be left empty but the field itself
#    must be present.
#
# 9) The text in the second field contains a programme title, a new episode
#    value to update, and a description to match against.
#
#
# Non-title information to remove from beginning of titles
