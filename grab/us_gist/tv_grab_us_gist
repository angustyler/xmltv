=head1 NAME

tv_grab_us_gist - Grab TV listings for the USA, from an alternative
source.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

tv_grab_us_gist [--help] [--output FILE] [--days N] [--offset N] [--quiet]

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Output TV listings for a particular user account at the US listings
site gist.com.  At the moment you need to manually register for an
account at that site and choose the channels to download using their
web interface.

The normal grabber for US listings is B<tv_grab_na>, but you might
prefer the data returned by this one.

=head1 SETUP

At the moment to set up this grabber you must register by hand at the
site.  Once you have logged in, find your user id by doing 'view
source' in your web browser and look near the bottom of the file for a
line such as

    <font COLOR=WHITE>Userid=5094954 profileid=1</font><br>

FIXME at the moment the user id is hardcoded into the script!  No
--configure stage.

Then run B<tv_grab_us_gist --configure> and enter the number shown, in
this case, 5094954.  The channels fetched by the grabber will be those
you set up during registration.

I donE<39>t know what the difference is between the ordinary,
free-of-charge gist.com subscription and the pay 'Gist Gold' service.
ItE<39>s possible that to customize the list of channels you must take
the pay service - otherwise you may be stuck with the default setting
of all channels for the region you selected.  Also, it may be that
Gold subscribers can fetch listings for more days.

Once you have set up the account and configured the grabber, no more
manual intervention should be necessary.

=head1 OPTIONS

B<--output FILE> write to FILE rather than standard output.

B<--days N> grab N days starting from today, rather than as many as
possible.

B<--offset N> start grabbing N days from today, rather than starting
today.  N may be negative.

B<--quiet> suppress the progress messages normally written to standard
error.

=head1 BUGS

It should be possible to fully automate the registration process.
