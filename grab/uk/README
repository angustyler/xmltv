tv_grab_uk version 5.x

If you're curious about what is in this directory:

- tv_grab_uk.in: source code for the grabber.  This is processed
  before installation to substitute in the name of the share/
  directory where some configuration files can be found (see below).
  But it is runnable directly.

- tv_grab_uk.PL: the program which processes tv_grab_uk.in to get the
  installed version.

- tv_grab_uk: not part of the source distribution!  If you see this
  file then it is just an intermediate file created by the build
  process and you should ignore it.  Edit tv_grab_uk.in instead.  It
  is confusing I know.

- channel_ids: this maps the internal ids used by Ananova to the XMLTV
  ids appearing in the output.  It also gives extra, short display
  names for some channels.  If a channel is not mentioned in this file
  it should still work however.  (Though that needs more testing.)

- channel_pkgs/: these are the 'packages' of channels to help the user
  with configuration.  They are used during --configure but not read
  when actually grabbing.

- test_configs/: some sample config files (using the undocumented
  --config-file argument) used during testing.  See t/parallel_test in
  the top level XMLTV distribution.

- xmltv_ananova.dtd: the files served by Ananova are close to XMLTV
  format but also have some extra information (which we don't
  currently use).  They should conform to this DTD, which is included
  for documentation only.

- README: you just did :-).
