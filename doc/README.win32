XMLTV 0.5.35, Windows binary release

Gather television listings, process them and organize your viewing.
XMLTV is a file format for storing TV listings, defined in xmltv.dtd.
Then there are several tools to produce and process these listings.

Please see doc\QuickStart for documentation on what each program does,
and xmltv.dtd for documentation on the file format.

This is a release of the software as a single Windows binary
xmltv.exe, generated from the Perl source code linked from
<http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=39046>.

* Known problems

Due to prerequisite problems, EXE support is not currently available
for tv_grab_jp. If you need that, you'll need to install Perl and the
necessary modules and use the full distribution.

Some users get errors in Perl58.dll when running tv_grab_na_dd. See
below for more info.

* Changes in this release (0.5.34)

tv_grab_uk_rt now works again.  It broke because it was blocked by the
website, but they have kindly started providing machine-readable data
files so the grabber has been rewritten to use those.  The new version
should be backwards compatible but data for radio stations is no
longer available.

tv_grab_pt is disabled in this release since the website it fetched
from appears defunct.

Many fixes to tv_grab_na_dd.  Fixes to tv_grab_de_tvtoday, many
contributed by Olaf Mandel.

A new grabber tv_grab_uk_bleb fetches listings from bleb.org.

tv_grab_se now supports more channels (patches from Alexander Bostrom).

tv_grab_dk was fixed for a recent site change.

tv_check now does case insensitive title lookups.

Small fixes to tv_grab_fr.

* Installation

There is no installer, just unpack the zipfile into a
directory such as C:\xmltv.  If you are reading this you've probably
already done that.

All the different programs are combined into a single executable.  For
example, instead of running 'tv_grab_na --days 2 >na.xml' you would run

c:\xmltv\xmltv.exe tv_grab_na_dd --days 2 --output a.xml

Apart from the extra 'xmltv.exe' at the front of each command line,
the usage should be the same as the Unix version.  Some programs make
use of a "share" directory.  That directory is assumed be named
"share" at the same location as the exe.  If you just keep everything
where you unzipped it, everything should be fine.  If you must move
xmltv.exe, you may need to specify a --share option with some
programs.

xmltv.exe will try and guess a timezone.  This usually works fine. If
it doesn't, you can set a TZ variable just like on unix.

* General Windows Notes

Spaces in filenames may cause problems with some programs.  Directories
with spaces (i.e. C:\program files\xmltv) are not recommended.
C:\xmltv is better.

Some of the programs allow you pass a date format on the command line.
This uses % followed by a letter to specify a component of a date, for
example %Y gives a four digit year.  This can cause problems on windows
since % is used as a shell escape character.

To get around this, use %% to pass a % to the application. (ex. %%Y%%M )

If you *DO* want to insert a shell variable, you can do so by surrounding
it with percents. (ex %HOME% )

* crash in with PERL58.DLL

When using tv_grab_na_dd, some users are experiencing a crash in the
Perl58.DLL.

I had a similar problem when I had an older version of Perl installed
as well as XMLTV. It seems to cause DLL confusion and eventually a program
crash.

I fixed my system when I removed the old Perl.  Re-installing Perl
didn't cause the problem to return.

Before that, I used the work-around below (I could fetch 3 days)

tv_grab_na_dd --output=a.xml --days 3
tv_grab_na_dd --output=b.xml --days 3 --offset 3
tv_grab_na_dd --output=c.xml --days 1 --offset 6
tv_cat a.xml b.xml c.xml >guide.xml

I really thought this problem would be a fluke and/or easily solved
when I solved it for myself.  That doesn't look to be the case.  I'm
looking for a solution.
