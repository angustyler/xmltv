XMLTV 0.3.1

Suite of programs for processing TV listings and organizing your
viewing.

You can grab TV listings for the USA, Canada and the UK.  They are
stored in an XML format.  Then you can sort them, filter them and
print them out.  There is a CGI script to help automate choosing what
to watch.

This release has a rewritten Canada/USA grabber, so listings for those
countries are now working again.  If you are comfortable using a
command line and want to take control of your TV viewing, it could be
useful.

This is free software distributed under the GPL, see COPYING.  But if
you would like to use the code under some other conditions, please do
