XMLTV 0.2.9

Suite of programs for processing TV listings and organizing your
viewing.

You can grab TV listings for the USA, Canada and the UK.  They are
stored in an XML format.  Then you can sort them, filter them and
print them out.  There is a CGI script to help automate choosing what
to watch.

(TV listings for the Netherlands have rotted, because the website they
were grabbed from has changed its format.  Listings for Austria are
also temporarily unavailable.)

This release is general tidying - the UK listings are now provided
direct from Ananova, and richer use is made of the XMLTV format.  We
also now use the channels.xml file properly rather than hardcoding
channel names :-).

It's still rough round the edges, but if you are comfortable
using a command line and want to take control of your TV viewing, it
could be useful.
