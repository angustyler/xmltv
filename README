XMLTV 0.5.13

Gather television listings, process them and organize your viewing.
XMLTV is a file format for storing TV listings, defined in xmltv.dtd.
Then there are several tools to produce and process these listings.

Please see doc/QuickStart for documentation on what each program does,
and xmltv.dtd for documentation on the file format.

* Changes in this release

This release is a quick one to patch tv_grab_na w.r.t. new zap2it
web site changes that came into effect June 30th.

* Installation

% perl Makefile.PL
% make
% make test
% make install

To install in a custom directory, replace the first line with
something like

% perl Makefile.PL PREFIX=/wherever/

The system requirements are perl 5.005_03 or later, and a few Perl
modules.  You will be asked about some optional components; if you
choose not to install them then there are fewer dependencies.  The
full list of needed modules is:

XML::Twig
XML::Writer
Date::Manip from <http://membled.com/work/patches/DateManip/>
LWP
Memoize (included with perl 5.8 and later)

HTML::Parser       (if you choose to install tv_grab_na)
HTML::TableExtract (if you choose to install tv_grab_sn)
HTML::TreeBuilder  (for many of the grabbers)
Tk::TableMatrix    (if you choose to install tv_check)
XML::Simple        (if you choose to install tv_check)
CGI                (if you choose to install tv_pick_cgi)

The grabber for New Zealand, tv_grab_nz, is written in Python so if
you want to run it you will need Python installed.

The following modules are recommended, but the software still works
without them:

Term::ProgressBar                (displays pretty progress meters)
Compress::Zlib                   (makes tv_grab_de a bit faster)
Lingua::Preferred                (helps with multilingual listings)
Unicode::String                  (non-ASCII chars in LaTeX output)
Lingua::EN::Numbers::Ordinate    (not really needed, to be honest)

And the Log::TraceMessages module is useful for debugging, but not
needed for normal use.

Apart from Date::Manip, all of these can be installed with tarballs
downloaded from CPAN or (hopefully) using the CPAN shell program:
'perl -MCPAN -e shell', then 'install XML::Twig' and so on.  But you
may find it easier to search for packaged versions from your OS vendor
or others - places which distribute a packaged version of xmltv will
often provide the modules it needs too.

For Date::Manip, you must get the version at
<http://membled.com/work/patches/DateManip/> rather than the one at
CPAN.  Again, there may be packaged versions of this 'epa' release for
your operating system.

* Author and copying
