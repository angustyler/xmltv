XMLTV 0.1.1

Suite of programs for processing TV listings and organizing your
viewing.

In a nutshell: get XML TV listings for the UK with getlistings_pa,
filter them through filter_shown, convert to LaTeX with
listings_to_latex, set preferences for which to watch by installing
pick_cgi as a CGI script.

This release is not ready for end users.  There have been lots of
changes since the last release, notably the introduction of timezones,
and the fact that it might actually work.

This is free software distributed under the GPL, see COPYING.
