XMLTV 0.4.3

Suite of programs for processing TV listings and organizing your
viewing.

You can grab TV listings for the USA, Canada and the UK.  They are
stored in an XML format.  Then you can sort them, filter them and
print them out.  There is a CGI script to help automate choosing what
to watch, and a program to track schedule changes and notify when a
programme isn't in its usual timeslot.

This version is 0.4.3.  It has small enhancements to the grabbers, in
particular a new getlistings_na after the website's format changed.
There have also been small changes to tvcheck.

For documentation, see the web page at
