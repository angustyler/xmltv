XMLTV 0.5.9

Gather television listings, process them and organize your viewing.
XMLTV is a file format for storing TV listings, defined in xmltv.dtd.
Then there are several tools to produce and process these listings.

Please see doc/QuickStart for documentation on what each program does,
and xmltv.dtd for documentation on the file format.

* Changes in this release

This section summarizes new features, there are also bug fixes but too
many to list individually.

A new filter program tv_imdb looks up programme details in the
Internet Movie Database and adds the information found to its output.

New grabbers:
	Italy				tv_grab_it
	Spain				tv_grab_es
	Netherlands			tv_grab_nl

Several of the grabbers now support the --list-channels option,
although it is not yet available for all.  There are some new channel
packages for the United Kingdom grabber tv_grab_uk, corresponding to
certain pay-TV subscription packages.

The grabber config filenames have changed to 'tv_grab_xx.conf' rather
than just 'tv_grab_xx'.  When you run the new grabber for the first
time it should migrate any existing config file to the new location.
On Unixlike systems the config file lives in ~/.xmltv/ as before.

The tv_grep filter program is now able to query on more programme
details and a new --on-before predicate has been added to complement
--on-after.  This lets you filter listings for what's on during a
given time period.

tv_sort does more sanity checking of programme times to make sure no
programme claims to stop before it starts.

* Known problems

On systems with a UTF-8 locale setting, the Date::Manip module
produces lots of warnings while loading.  This is most often seen with
Red Hat Linux 8.0 which uses UTF-8 locales by default.  For example,
LC_ALL and LANG may be set to 'en_US.UTF-8' instead of just 'en_US'.
Changing them back to 'en_US' stops the warnings, but turns off UTF-8
support in some applications.  This is not really a bug with XMLTV but
more related to the Date::Manip module; the solution given here is
just a workaround. Minor problems and detailed bug descriptions
are available in individual grabber and utility BUGS sections.

* Installation

% perl Makefile.PL
% make
% make test
% make install

To install in a custom directory, replace the first line with
something like

% perl Makefile.PL PREFIX=/wherever/

The system requirements are perl 5.005_03 or later, and a few Perl
modules.  You will be asked about some optional components; if you
choose not to install them then there are fewer dependencies.  The
full list of needed modules is:

XML::Twig
XML::Writer
Date::Manip
LWP

HTML::Parser       (if you choose to install tv_grab_na)
HTML::TableExtract (if you choose to install tv_grab_sn)
HTML::TreeBuilder  (if you choose to install tv_grab_fi)
Tk::TableMatrix    (if you choose to install tv_check)
XML::Simple        (if you choose to install tv_check)
CGI                (if you choose to install tv_pick_cgi)

The grabber for New Zealand, tv_grab_nz, is written in Python so if
you want to run it you will need Python installed.

The following modules are recommended, but the software still works
without them:

Memoize                          (makes some programs a bit faster)
Term::ProgressBar                (displays pretty progress meters)
Compress::Zlib                   (makes tv_grab_de a bit faster)
Lingua::Preferred                (helps with multilingual listings)
Unicode::String                  (non-ASCII chars in LaTeX output)
Lingua::EN::Numbers::Ordinate    (not really needed, to be honest)

And the Log::TraceMessages module is useful for debugging, but not
needed for normal use.

All of these, if they aren't included as packages with your OS, can be
installed with tarballs downloaded from CPAN or (hopefully) using the
CPAN shell program: 'perl -MCPAN -e shell', then 'install XML::Twig'
and so on.
