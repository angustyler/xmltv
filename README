XMLTV 0.5.3

Gather television listings, process them and organize your viewing.
XMLTV is a file format for storing TV listings, defined in xmltv.dtd.
Then there are several tools to produce and process these listings.

Please see doc/QuickStart for documentation on what each program does,
and xmltv.dtd for documentation on the file format.

* Changes in this release

The main focus is to fix the tv_grab_na (North America) grabber, which
broke after changes to the website it fetches data from.  It has had
other changes to make it more resilient to site failures.  There have
also been small fixes to the other included grabbers, to tv_check, and
to the filter programs tv_cat and tv_extractinfo_en.

To fix reported problems on some platforms, some Perl module
dependencies now require newer versions.  You now need XML::Twig
version 3.09 and perl-libwww-perl (LWP) version 5.65, and if you want
to run the Sweden/Norway grabber you need HTML::TableExtract version
1.08.

* Known problems

On systems with a UTF-8 locale setting, the Date::Manip module
produces lots of warnings while loading.  This is most often seen with
Red Hat Linux 8.0 which uses UTF-8 locales by default.  For example,
LC_ALL and LANG may be set to 'en_US.UTF-8' instead of just 'en_US'.
Changing them back to 'en_US' stops the warnings, but turns off UTF-8
support in some applications.  This is not really a bug with XMLTV but
more related to the Date::Manip module; the solution given here is
just a workaround.

* Installation

% perl Makefile.PL
% make
% make test
% make install

To install in a custom directory, replace the first line with
something like

% perl Makefile.PL PREFIX=/wherever/

The system requirements are perl 5.005_03 or later, and a few Perl
modules.  You will be asked about some optional components; if you
choose not to install them then there are fewer dependencies.  The
full list of needed modules is:

XML::Twig
XML::Writer
Date::Manip
LWP

HTML::Parser       (if you choose to install tv_grab_na)
HTML::TableExtract (if you choose to install tv_grab_sn)
Tk::TableMatrix    (if you choose to install tv_check)
XML::Simple        (if you choose to install tv_check)
CGI                (if you choose to install tv_pick_cgi)

The following modules are recommended, but the software still works
without them:

Memoize                          (makes some programs a bit faster)
Term::ProgressBar                (displays pretty progress meters)
Compress::Zlib                   (makes tv_grab_de a bit faster)
Lingua::Preferred                (helps with multilingual listings)
Unicode::String                  (non-ASCII chars in LaTeX output)
Lingua::EN::Numbers::Ordinate    (not really needed, to be honest)

And the Log::TraceMessages module is useful for debugging, but not
needed for normal use.

All of these, if they aren't included as packages with your OS, can be
installed with tarballs downloaded from CPAN or (hopefully) using the
CPAN shell program: 'perl -MCPAN -e shell', then 'install XML::Twig'
and so on.
