XMLTV 0.5

Gather television listings, process them and organize your viewing.
XMLTV is a file format for storing TV listings, defined in xmltv.dtd.
Then there are several tools to produce and process these listings.

Changes: With the 0.5 release we are moving to a proper packaging /
build system.  Instead of just dumping the files in a single
directory, we use a Makefile.PL to install them in standard Unix
locations under a given prefix.  This also allows us to generate
manual pages and run tests with 'make test'.  For this prerelease most
but not all of the packaging work is done: some manual pages have not
yet been written and there is no 'make uninstall'.

In features, the most important change is a new grabber tv_grab_de for
German-language TV listings (I'm not sure whether it actually
corresponds to Germany or Austria or both).  This fetches XMLTV files
provided by Gottfried Szing from his database.  tv_grab_uk has a
--configure mode, and a new filter tv_cat concatenates or merges
listing files.  There are several bugfixes and small enhancements to
various programs.

Please see doc/QuickStart for documentation on what each program does,
and xmltv.dtd for documentation on the file format.

* Installation

% perl Makefile.PL
% make
% make test
% make install

However, the 'make test' step could take a very long time unless you
have a fast, new machine, so you might want to skip it.

To install in a custom directory, replace the first line with
something like

% perl Makefile.PL PREFIX=/wherever/

The system requirements are perl 5.005_03 or later, and a few Perl
modules.  You will be asked about some optional components; if you
choose not to install them then there are fewer dependencies.  The
full list of needed modules is:

XML::DOM
XML::Twig
XML::Writer
Date::Manip
LWP

HTML::Parser       (if you choose to install tv_grab_na)
Tk::TableMatrix    (if you choose to install tv_check)
XML::Simple        (if you choose to install tv_check)
CGI                (if you choose to install tv_pick_cgi)

The following modules are recommended, but the software still works
without them:

Memoize                          (makes some programs a bit faster)
Term::ProgressBar                (displays pretty progress meters)
Compress::Zlib                   (makes tv_grab_de a bit faster)
Lingua::Preferred                (helps with multilingual listings)
Unicode::String                  (non-ASCII chars in LaTeX output)
Lingua::EN::Numbers::Ordinate    (not really needed, to be honest)

And the Log::TraceMessages module is useful for debugging, but not
needed for normal use.

All of these, if they aren't included as packages with your OS, can be
installed with tarballs downloaded from CPAN or (hopefully) using the
CPAN shell program: 'perl -MCPAN -e shell', then 'install XML::Twig'
and so on.
