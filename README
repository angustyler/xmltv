XMLTV 0.4.4

Gather television listings, process them and organize your viewing.
XMLTV is a file format for storing TV listings, defined in xmltv.dtd.
Then there are several tools to produce and process these listings.

Changes: This release contains bugfixes and a couple of new filter
programs, tv_grep and tv_extractinfo_en.  And all the tools have been
renamed since 0.4.3, so they have more consistent names: for example
the old sort_listings is now called tv_sort.  filter_shown has been
removed, its functionality is covered by 'tv_grep --on-after now'.

Please see doc/QuickStart for documentation on what each program does,
and xmltv.dtd for documentation on the file format.
