XMLTV 0.2.1

Suite of programs for processing TV listings and organizing your
viewing.

You can grab TV listings for Canada, the Netherlands, and the UK.
They are stored in an XML format.  Listings are also available in this
format for Austria.  Then you can sort them, filter them and print
them out.  There is a CGI script to help automate choosing what to
watch.

It's still rough round the edges, but if you are comfortable
using a command line and want to take control of your TV viewing, it
could be useful.
