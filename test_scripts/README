Unfortunately we do not yet have an automated test suite.  But here
are a couple of tools used for checking new versions of grabbers or
XMLTV.pm.  Sample input for some of the filter programs is in
test_data/.  We do have some test data which cannot be distributed
since it contains real TV listings which are copyright.
