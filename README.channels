This is a Perl module to handle conversions between internal channel
names (which try to follow RFC2838, eg channel4.com) and the pretty,
human-readable names ('display names').  It's not used at present but
it should be soon.

The DTD and the two example XML files show how to list this
information.  Hopefully we will also have some means of looking up
channel numbers - at present this is done by listings_to_latex, but
hardcoded.  It should probably go into this module too.

This module is being developed by Gottfried Szing.
