The two listings-grabbers write a channels.xml file to map between
internal channel IDs and pretty names.  The format of the file is by
Gottfried Szing.  There are a couple of interfaces to these files -
TVChannels.pm in attic/ provides lookup functions, and XMLTV.pm
provides routines to read channels.xml into a Perl data structure and
write it out again.
