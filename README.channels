The two listings-grabbers write a channels.xml file to map between
internal channel IDs and pretty names.  The format of the file is by
Gottfried Szing.  There are a couple of interfaces to these files -
TVChannels.pm in attic/ provides lookup functions, and XMLTV.pm
provides routines to read channels.xml into a Perl data structure and
write it out again.

Rearranged (or added) comments at the start of each file, so the
description is near the top and the changelog near the bottom.  Added
$Log: $ lines to get an automatically updated changelog from now on; I
hope it works.
