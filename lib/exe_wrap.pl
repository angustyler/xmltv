# This is a quick XMLTV shell routing to use with the windows exe

# A single EXE is needed to allow sharing of modules and dlls of all the
# programs.  If PerlAPP was run on each one, the total size would be more than
# 12MB, even leaving out PERL56.DLL!

# Perlapp allows you to attach pathed files, but you need the same path
# to access them.  The Makefile creates a text file of these files which is
# used to build a translation table, allowing users to just type the app name
# and not the development path.

Sorry, tv_grab_nz is not available in this Windows binary release,
although if you have Python installed you will be able to get it from
the xmltv source distribution.

It is hoped that future Windows binaries for xmltv will include a way
to run tv_grab_nz.
