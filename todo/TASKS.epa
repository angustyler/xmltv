FIXMEs

In DTD, maybe modify channel references to use the official XML way of
referring back to stuff.

Proper installation routine (Makefile.PL?)
Make Perl modules live in XMLTV:: namespace (patch from Justin Hallett)
Add Tie::IxHash, Term::ProgressBar as dependency - done
getlistings_uk_ananova: squeeze repeated hyphens in guessed names
Write grep_listings at last

Suggestions from Jerry V.

- next shown (we decided it's not needed)
- shouldn't the channel # and station name be separate (dealt with; each
  channel can have zero or more pretty names)
- programmes should have taped/joined in progress/live (TODO)
- should indicate HDTV somehow (TODO)
- make it clear that channel attribute references channels.xml.  (Done;
  channels.xml is no more.  But see above.)

Decided not to deal with channel affiliations.
