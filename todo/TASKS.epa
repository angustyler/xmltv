In DTD, maybe modify channel references to use the official XML way of
referring back to stuff.

Proper installation routine (Makefile.PL?) - done
Make Perl modules live in XMLTV:: namespace (patch from Justin Hallett) - done
tv_grab_uk: squeeze repeated hyphens in guessed names
Write grep_listings at last -- done, tv_grep
Merge almost-same channels (eg BBC1 SE vs BBC1 Digital) -- not doing, change to DTD unpopular

'Discovery Plus 1'

Eliminate colons in output times. - done

--output - done

05:00--05:00, it means '24 hours' but looks odd

Suggestions from Jerry V.

- next shown (we decided it's not needed)
- programmes should have taped/joined in progress/live (TODO)
- should indicate HDTV somehow (TODO)
- separate film, cartoon etc from <category>

Decided not to deal with channel affiliations.

Do something about dates, XMLTV.pm should parse dates itself and
return structures with date objects in them, not just strings.  But
this requires a date class which knows about partial dates (by
extending Date::Manip or otherwise).  Should probably get rid of
partial dates in many places (start and stop times), that would solve
the problem.  Maybe date of a film could be restricted to year only.
Shouldn't require same date format for all these things.

is what I plan anyway):

- Sort out this multiple-broadcast question.  I'm moving towards
having a <broadcast> subelement of programme, should go and re-read
what was said on the mailing list.  Personally I favour one
<broadcast> per <programme> and multiple <channel>s per <broadcast>.

Jerry says:

DTD should specify ordering of channels and programmes (or actively
not-specify).

Make sure Date::Manip works when can't get timezone from environment
(eg on Windows).  Actually I think this is done already.  Should
check.

Fix this episode_num stuff, I admit it is just silly.

Look into Brian J. Murrell's schedule program.

Stephane Zermatten's suggestions about dual audio channels in
different languages (see my reply on the mailing list).  Sort out
video/audio/subtitles generally.
