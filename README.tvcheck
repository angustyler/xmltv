This file describes the tvcheck module of XMLTV.

TVCHECK is a Perl script that reads in a file with show information and
checks it against a TV guide listing, alerting you to unexpected episodes
or schedule changes.

Questions/Comments/Suggestions/Thanks are, of course welcome.

How to use the script.
----------------------

The default show  file name is shows.xml
The default guide file name is guide.xml


1. Step one, download guide information.
   (for example, getlistings_na or getlistings_uk)

2. use tvcheck to create a "show file"

	tvcheck --configure --guide=your_guide_file.xml

   Pick some shows to track, Click Add to add to the list.
   Select File, Save-as, to save your output
   exit tvcheck

3. use tvcheck to scan the guide
	tvcheck --scan --guide=your_guide_file.xml --shows=my_show_file.xml


Sample shows.xml file
=======================
<tvcheck>
  <lang>en_US</lang>
  <shows day="Sun" channel="10402" hhmm="2000" len="60" title="The X-Files"  />
  <shows day="Mon" channel="10402" hhmm="1900" len="30" title="That '70s Show" dayonly="1" />
</tvcheck>

Parameters
====================
 lang   : preferred language.  Optional, can have multiple, in order of preferences
 shows  : list of shows you're interested in

Show attributes:
====================
 day    : day of the week and Sun,Mon,Tue,Wed,Thu,Fri,Sat
 channel: channelID used by the guide
 title  : *EXACT* title of show.
 hhmm   : start time of show (hhmm)
 len    : expected length of show in minutes ( this may become optional )

Optional attributes:
====================
 chanonly: if 1, episode scan ignores shows onother channels
 dayonly : if 1, episode scan ignores shows on other days
 timeonly: if 1, episode scan ignores shows at other times
 neartime: if 1, episode scan only reports shows within a 3 hour window

Output notes
============
"No Guide Info" means no guide information was found for that channel at that time.
		something may be wrong with the channel ID,listing fetch, or the 
		guide file is just old.



Notes: 
----------------------
I'm planning on adding a recording conflict checker. ( yes it will support multiple
recording devices and the fuzzy logic of a ReplayTV )

The XML is a memory hog.  I have a 2MB guide file and TVCHECK needs about 110MB
of working set to run.  The guide takes 40 seconds to load.  Indexing takes 20 seconds
for a --scan, but 100 seconds for a configure ( configure does lots of date calcs when
indexing ).

Known bug:
---------------------
If you select a title in the title selection list and then try and select a blank day 
or channel the field doesn't blank.  I have no clue.  The variable doesn't match the
displayed value... looks like a TK bug to me.
